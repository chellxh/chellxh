## About Me

I am a passionate Full Stack <strong>Software Developer</strong> with dreams of creating my ✨OWN✨ company. I love technology and the advancements that have shaped it today. 

My coding skills are developing through an <strong>intensive</strong> Fellowship at Pursuit, a NYC-based 🔥 <em>Full Stack Web Development Program</em> 🔥 with a 9% acceptance rate. When I'm not studying or reading up on coding resources, I like to spend time with my husband and 2 children and watch movies & anime.
